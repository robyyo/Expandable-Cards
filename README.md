# Expandable Card Example

This project is part of the 50 Projects in 50 Days - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript video series. Packt August 2021 By Brad Traversy and Florin Pop

## Concept

This is a cool UI component for displaying image content without taking up a lot of screen real estate.

## Usage

Background images can be added to each element. More elements can be added if it suits your purposes.

## TODO

I'd like to work on positioning the text in each panel better.
